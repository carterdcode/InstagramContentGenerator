## About

I originally made this to see how easy it would be to setup fully automatic content creation via text posts. Turns out it is extremely easy, but I didn't want to go bankrupt on API tokens. Code may or may not be functional, it has been quite a while since I used it.
## Installation

Install tkinter, pillow, openAI. 

## Usage
Create a background image for the text to be written to.
Ensure you change all "FILE PATH HERE" etc to the correct file paths, there are quite a few, and add your correct API Key.
Ensure you add detailed context to the context variable, or it wont work, may need to edit the initial prompt as well as it is an old GPT jailbreak.
